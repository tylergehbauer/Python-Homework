Homework assignment 2
I unfortunatley wasn't able to complete PyRamen portion. I feel like I was very close though.
The problem I had was near the end with the else: print statement. 
It would just print an insane amount of lines which would make my computer lag.
It seems I went wrong somewhere during the nested loop.
